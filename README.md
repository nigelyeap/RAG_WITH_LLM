# RAG_WITH_LLM

Be sure to install all required dependencies and libraries before running.

RAG(Retrieval-augmented generation) works by analysing a pdf document of your choice on any matter. 
By running said pdf through a LLM, such as DeepSeek, a free LLM available on the internet, specific questions on the contents of the document can be provided.
RAG can also produce detailed summaries, find discrepancies in the document and much more.

Download Ollama beforehand at https://ollama.com/download to run the code smoothly.

This is just an amateur trial, let me know if there is anything I should improve on.
