# RAG_WITH_LLM

Be sure to install all required dependencies and libraries before running.

RAG(Retrieval-augmented generation) works by analysing a pdf document of your choice on any matter. By running said pdf through a LLM, such as OpenSeek, a free LLM available on the internet, any questions on the contents of the document can be provided.

Download Ollama beforehand at https://ollama.com/download to run the code smoothly.

This is just an amateur trial, let me know if there is anything I should improve on.
